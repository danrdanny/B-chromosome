Code used in Hanlon et al 2018 (preprint here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/07/386995).

Code in the SOAP directory was used to trim and subset unmpaped reads. SOAP was then run over a number of kmers. Assemblies greater than 500 bp using a kmer size of 41 are here.

Code in the K-seek directory is an adapted version of K-seek from Wei et al. 2014 (http://www.pnas.org/content/111/52/18793). The code was modified to run on our systems and a third component, called k.compile.pl was written to summarize data output by the original version of K-seek.

Illumina sequencing reads generated in this report are available at the National Center for Biotechnology
